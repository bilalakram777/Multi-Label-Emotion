Multi-Label Emotion Recognition from Text
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of classifying multiple emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, etc.) that are present in textual data. The system will analyze and detect the emotional tone of texts, which can be used for a variety of applications, such as customer feedback analysis or sentiment analysis in social media posts.

Dataset
Dataset Name: GoEmotions Dataset by Google

Description: The GoEmotions dataset contains 58 different emotions in textual form, including both discrete and nuanced emotions. It is designed to facilitate the development of multi-label emotion classification models.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and tokenizing the dataset.

Handling imbalanced data using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

Model Training:

Fine-tuning a transformer model such as BERT to handle the multi-label classification problem.

Adjusting hyperparameters and training the model on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance using metrics like Hamming Loss and F1 Score to ensure the modelâ€™s accuracy and precision in classifying multiple emotions.

Real-World Testing:

Testing the system with real-world textual data, such as customer feedback or social media posts, to validate its practical utility.
